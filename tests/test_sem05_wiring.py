"""Regression test for the SEM-05 wiring gap.

Prior to this patch, SEM-05 existed only as prose in
contracts/standards/SEMANTIC_INPUT_STANDARD.md: it was registered in neither
CONTRACT_MANIFEST.json's requirement_index nor EXECUTION_CONTRACT.json's
DRAFT_PROMPT/REVISE_PROMPT requirements, so ContextCompiler.compile() never
included it in APPLICABLE_STANDARD_CLAUSES and no worker ever saw it. This
test asserts the clause is actually present in the compiled projection for
both operations that produce Prompt Pseudocode, and that its text still
contains the load-bearing normative language if it is ever edited again.
